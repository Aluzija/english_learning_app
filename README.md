# README

This project is not completed and has no front-end done yet. The vision of the project is to create an app which enable user to store eng-pl translations in private dictionary and learn them.
Main features:
 - alogaritm authomatically create english synonyms of words based on already existing words,
 - when word is deleted and other record/records in database have this word in english_synonyms column, those records are authomatically updated to deletion of this word from english_synonyms column,
 - app provide a handfull of exercises to help memorize words from private dictionary and repetition system.

For now the main features works but there're some bugs to remove. For example, app doesn't work properly if there is not enough words in dictionary.
I also have to work on frond-end!
